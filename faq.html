<h1>FAQ<span class="fl"></span></h1>

<h3><b>Q1.</b> What is ImageWarp?</h3>
<p><b>A1.</b> ImageWarp is a high-performance image analysis and editing software application, which combines the power of a graphic development environment with a comprehensive image analysis toolset. ImageWarp can be used with numerous acquisition devices to provide real-time image acquisition or simply as a tool for analyzing static images. Download the 2-page brochure by clicking <a href="http://www.bitflow.com/pdfs/iw_lrbrochure.pdf">here [1.18MB]</a>.

<h3><b>Q2.</b> How does ImageWarp fit in with the rest of BitFlow's imaging products?</h3>
<p><b>A2.</b> ImageWarp fills a void in BitFlow's current product line by offering a well-integrated software solution that fully supports our existing line of frame grabber products. You can now use BitFlow's products for more than camera interfacing and acquisition. By taking advantage of ImageWarp's sophisticated BitFlow driver and our superior FlowThru architecture, we can now offer you a complete solution.

<h3><b>Q3.</b> What Image Analysis/Image Processing functionality does ImageWarp have?</h3>
<p><b>A3.</b> ImageWarp contains hundreds of functions for performing image analysis and processing. Refer to <a href="features.html">Features</a> for a complete list of ImageWarp functions.

<h3><b>Q4.</b> How does ImageWarp's performance and features compare to other image analysis products?</h3>
<p><b>A4.</b> ImageWarp runs almost 3 times faster than comparable products. It is best compared to Media Cybernetics' Image-Pro. Below are some ImageWarp benchmarks and list of features that distinguish ImageWarp 1.50 from the competition:

<h3><b>Q5.</b> What acquisition/imaging devices does ImageWarp currently support?</h3>
<p><b>A5.</b> ImageWarp fully supports the entire line of BitFlow frame grabbers as well as standard imaging devices such as Fire Wire, USB cameras (via VFW and WDM drivers) and TWAIN devices. Support for other frame grabber products will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with the decision ultimately determined by the size of the opportunity.
<p>NOTE: In order to use BitFlow products with ImageWarp, you will need to have the FREE drivers-only version of SDK 4.00 or higher installed on your computer.

<h3><b>Q6.</b> What programming environment can I use to write applications using ImageWarp?</h3>
<p><b>A6.</b> ImageWarp features a VB-like scripting tool in order to develop applications for use within the ImageWarp environment. An SDK that allows direct access to the highly optimized algorithms is in development and will be made available soon. There are currently more than 30 example applications that can be used to assist you with the creation of your own application. In addition, ImageWarp offers an extensive set of DDE functions which allows users to control ImageWarp from a third party application and exchange images and data. Using the DDE mechanism, ImageWarp can be instructed to run in an invisible mode, so that the end-user can be presented with a custom user interface. A console-based example of this capability is provided in the documentation.

<h3><b>Q7.</b> Can ImageWarp be interfaced to external devices such as PLC?</h3>
<p><b>A7.</b> Yes. ImageWarp has a comprehensive set of serial communication and I/O functions that can be used to interchange data and signals with other computers, machines, and laboratory equipment. System integrators can use ImageWarp to build fully automated vision systems for quality control, web inspection, robotic assembly, and many other applications. 

<h3><b>Q8.</b> Can multiple copies of ImageWarp run simultaneously on a single PC?</h3>
<p><b>A8.</b> Yes. In fact, by creating several copies of ImageWarp's root directory along with the driver folder, you can also run each copy with a separate video source. In addition, we are currently adding the ability for each copy of ImageWarp to communicate with each other in the event synchronization is required (see previous question).

<h3><b>Q9.</b> Can ImageWarp be customized to fit my requirements?</h3>
<p><b>A9.</b> ImageWarp includes numerous example scripts and images designed to demonstrate its capabilities. You can also provide us with a sample images in order to perform a 'test' analysis.
<p>In the event that you require ImageWarp to be customized to suit your application requirements, BitFlow will be more than happy to evaluate these requirements and provide a quotation or recommend a 3rd Party for these services.

<h3><b>Q10.</b> Is a demo version of ImageWarp available?</h3>
<p><b>A10.</b> Yes. ImageWarp has 2 demonstration levels that can either be downloaded from <a href="download.html">Download</a> page or installed from a demo CD. In order to use the demos, you will need to have a network card present in your computer.
<p>Each demo level has certain limitations relative to the licensed commercial release.
<p>Limited Demo:<ul>
 <li>14-day trial period<li>Only the Simulation Device is supported (no support for BitFlow frame grabbers, Fire Wire, VFW, WDM or TWAIN devices)<li>Only demo images can be opened from the hard drive
 <li>Images can be saved in the ImageWarp proprietary format (IWD) only<li>Images cannot be copied to or pasted from the Clipboard
 <li>A number of selected functions are disabled
 <li>Execution of scripts is interrupted every 60 seconds
</ul>
<p>The Limited Demo can be upgraded to the Registered Demo through the registration procedure. The Registered Demo has full functionality of the commercial release with the following exceptions:<ul>
 <li>21-day trial period
 <li>Only BitFlow and Fire Wire (IEEE-1394) camera interfaces are supported for video capture
		<li>Images can be saved in the ImageWarp proprietary format (IWD) only
		<li>Images cannot be copied to or pasted from the Clipboard 
		<li>Only a limited amount of measurement data can be recorded or exported
	</ul>
